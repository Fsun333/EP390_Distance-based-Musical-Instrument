## Overview

This instrument is based on using an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance and generate sound. It can produce signals in different frequency ranges, including:

- Sine waves
- Square waves
- Sawtooth waves
- Triangle waves

This instrument can be used for sound design or live performances.

### Instrument Control

- **Distance and Sound Interaction**: When the detected object is farther from the sensor, the signal will generate a slow sequence and will be produced from the right audio channel. As the object moves closer to the sensor, the speed of the signal sequence will increase, gradually shifting to the left audio channel.
  
- **Waveform Switching**: Pressing the button allows you to switch between different waveforms.

- **Frequency Control**: Turning the potentiometer controls the frequency range, from low to high.
